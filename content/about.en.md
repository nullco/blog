My name is Juan and I work as a software developer. I have had the chance to work in several stacks, specially on backend. I decided to open this blog so I can share opinions, thoughs and experiences along my journey in the tech industry. I feel that writing about this stuff will help me to clarify my thougths and have clearer concepts about what I learn. I hope it can also help others :smiley:
